# EPA Modeling Parameters
This repository contains files that show the parameters used to model the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPAs) new proposed regulations for methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. 

Two leak size distributions were used in the Leak Detection and Repair Simulator (LDAR-Sim) developed at the University of Calgary to simulate methane emissions across a virtual oil and gas asset base. Four different screening technology minimum detection limits (MDLs) (1, 5, 10, and 25 kg/h) were evaluted for emissions reduction efficacy on each leak size distribution. Each .yaml file contains the model parameters that were used in each set of simulations. These files can be used along with the model source code in the LDAR-Sim public repository to reproduce simulation results.

# EPA Modeling Parameters
This repository contains files that show the input parameters used to model the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPAs) new proposed regulations for methane emissions from the oil and gas sector with the Leak Detection and Repair Simulator (LDAR-Sim).

LDAR-Sim was developed at the University of Calgary. Please see [Fox et al. 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620352811) for more information on LDAR-Sim and the [LDAR-Sim public repository](https://github.com/LDAR-Sim/LDAR_Sim) for instructions on how to install, set-up, and run the model.

Two leak size distributions: [Clearstone (2018)](https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/UpdateofEquipmentComponentandFugitiveEmissionFactorsforAlber-1.pdf) and [Zavala-Araiza et al. 2015](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/51/15597.short) were used in LDAR-Sim to simulate methane emissions across a virtual oil and gas asset base. The purpose of this modeling was to evaluate the efficacy of different Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) programs that use screening technologies with different minimum detection limits (MDLs) (1, 5, 10, and 25 kg/h) and frequencies (1-6x/yr) on each emissions distribution. Each .yaml file contains the model input parameters used at the global, program, and method levels in each set of simulations with a different MDL. These files can be used to populate the input parameters in the model source code available in the [LDAR-Sim public repository](https://github.com/LDAR-Sim/LDAR_Sim) to reproduce simulation results.
